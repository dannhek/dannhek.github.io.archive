### About Me

Epidemiologist and Data Scientist. I want to understand the world.

Many people try to answer empirical questions with non-empirical evidence. I want to change that.

I work with Dr. Brian Patterson to research the effects of informatics-based interventions in the emergency department on patient outcomes, especially falls and cognitive impairment screenings.
